About Schmidt is a 2002 American comedy-drama film co-written and directed by Alexander Payne and starring Jack Nicholson in the title role. 
The film also stars Hope Davis, Dermot Mulroney, and Kathy Bates. 
It is loosely based on the 1996 novel of the same title by Louis Begley. 
About Schmidt was theatrically released on December 13, 2002, by New Line Cinema. 
The film was both a commercial and critical success, earning $105.8 million on a $30 million budget.

Roger Ebert gave About Schmidt three-and-a-half out of four stars and wrote the following for the Chicago Sun-Times:
 About Schmidt "is essentially a portrait of a man without qualities, baffled by the emotions and needs of others. 
That Jack Nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft, but to his legend: 
Jack is so unlike Schmidt that his performance generates a certain awe. 
Another actor might have made the character too tragic or passive or empty, but Nicholson somehow finds within Schmidt a slowly developing hunger, a desire to start living now that the time is almost gone."[9]
